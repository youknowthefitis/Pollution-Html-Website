Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole.<br><br>
Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Energy program at NRDC.<br>
 “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it. <br>
“Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution is then worsened by that increased heat: Smog<br>
 forms when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants including mold (thanks to damp<br>
 conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season and more pollen production).<br><br>
“While we’ve made progress over the last 40-plus years improving air quality in the U.S. thanks to the Clean Air Act, climate change will make it harder<br> in the future to meet pollution standards,br
 which are designed to protect health,” says Kim Knowlton, senior scientist and deputy director of the NRDC Science Center.<br><br>
